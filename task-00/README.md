## download ubuntu

  Well to be honest i actually downloaded it in a virtual box instead of dual boot (because i was so focused on downloading it)
  And i was like "oh dammit man" after a ruler from discord named Arun mentioned it then i went bonkers for a min lol then afterwards in 30 minutes i downloaded the ubuntu dual boot and the task was successfull i guess xd
